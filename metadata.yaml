description: He had been married scarcely a year, yet even in the illusions of the
  honeymoon the woman, older than himself, and the widow of his old patron, had half
  unconsciously reasserted herself, and slipped back into the domination of her old
  position. As Clarence Brant, President of the Robles Land Company, and husband of
  the rich widow of John Peyton, of the Robles Ranche, mingled with the outgoing audience
  of the Cosmopolitan Theatre, at San Francisco, he elicited the usual smiling nods
  and recognition due to his good looks and good fortune. But as he hurriedly slipped
  through the still lingering winter's rain into the smart coupe that was awaiting
  him, and gave the order "Home," the word struck him with a peculiarly ironical significance.
  His home was a handsome one, and lacked nothing in appointment and comfort, but
  he had gone to the theatre to evade its hollow loneliness. Nor was it because his
  wife was not there, for he had a miserable consciousness that her temporary absence
  had nothing to do with his homelessness. The distraction of the theatre over that
  dull, vague, but aching sense of loneliness which was daily growing upon him returned
  with greater vigor.
